Sri Lanka stands as a global leader in vein graphite production, renowned for its exceptional purity and distinct crystal structure. Vein graphite, characterized by its high purity and well-defined crystal lattice, serves as an ideal precursor for the extraction of graphene â€“ a single-layer carbon structure resembling a hexagonal honeycomb. The unique attributes of graphene make it highly desirable for diverse applications. Benefiting from a consistent and dependable supply of vein graphite, Sri Lanka holds a competitive edge in producing top-tier graphene at a lower production cost. This advantage enhances the economic viability of large-scale commercial production. The utilization of high-quality starting material ensures the creation of graphene with minimal defects, further emphasizing Sri Lanka's position as a key player in the global graphene market. 

We have successfully transitioned from a bench-scale reaction to the establishment of a commercial graphene production plant. This significant advancement marks our commitment to large-scale manufacturing of graphene. The transition allows us to leverage economies of scale, increasing production efficiency and meeting the growing demand for graphene in various industries.
We have used three graphite mines in Sri Lanka to test the graphene production. The synthesis of graphene oxide involves chemically treating graphite through the use of reagents such as H2SO4, KMnO4, H2O2, and/or H2O. The resulting graphene oxide films, produced through the described method, we analyze our graphene using various techniques such as Raman spectroscopy, XRD and Scanning electron microscopy(SEM) to ensure the quality of the graphene. These analyses confirmed the successful generation of single to few-layer graphene oxide, showcasing a relatively broad lateral size distribution as a result of the disclosed procedure.
